# Zombies @ Phoneburnia is made to be difficult, a cooperative zombie killing gamemode.
* Zombies will endlessly respawn in a variety of amazing maps developed by Dr.Timothy, Moroes, Damas, Zlots and possibly others!
* Every monster you kill will send you and your team a small amount of points.
* Rebels and Combine are unable to kill each other, they must work together to clear the streets of dangerous zombies
* Monsters in this gamemode are: zombies, fastzombies, vortigaunts, headcrabs, fastheadcrabs, antlions and antlion guards.
* Server carries a few helpful workaround fixes such as !models that will let players choose any model without the error "please wait 4   seconds"

## How to set this up
* Replace all the files in your FTP Client, ONLY REPLACE THE hl2mp FOLDER WITH THIS hl2mp FOLDER.
* If you're setting this up for Singleplayer, just replace your bin's server.dll with this server.dll and optionally copy the server.cfg and replace your's. Remember to include the pb maps client side too.

## Errors
* Vortigaunts slightly aim a bit off.

If a developer is willing to fix this, please contact me so I can implement the fix.
