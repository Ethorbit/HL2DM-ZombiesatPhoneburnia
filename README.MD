# Zombies (@ Phoneburnia) is made to be difficult, a cooperative zombie killing gamemode.
* Zombies will endlessly respawn in a variety of amazing maps developed by Dr.Timothy, Moroes, Damas, Zlotz and possibly others!
* Every monster you kill will send you and your team a small amount of points.
* Rebels and Combine are unable to kill each other, they must work together to clear the streets of dangerous zombies
* Monsters in this gamemode are: zombies, fastzombies, vortigaunts, headcrabs, fastheadcrabs, antlions and antlion guards.
* Server carries a few helpful workaround fixes such as !models that will let players choose any model without the error "please wait 4   seconds"

## How to set this up
* Replace all the files in your FTP Client or SRCDS directory. Don't delete any files, but rather merge this hl2mp folder with yours.
Make sure to clear out admins.cfg in the addons/sourcemod, I might've forgotten.
* If you're setting this up for Singleplayer, just replace your bin's server.dll with this server.dll and optionally copy the server.cfg and replace your's. Remember to include the pb maps client side too.

## Errors
* Vortigaunts slightly aim a bit off.
* Unfixable exploit to kill players.
* Fastzombies jump towards the player but stop from the force of nothing. (Doesn't happen all the time)
* Zombies die in one hit from the shotgun attack2 sometimes (It's supposed to be 2 hits with attack2)
* A few difficulty system configurations for some maps have vanished. (This is being worked on and almost completely fixed)

If a developer is willing to fix this, please contact me so I can implement the fix.
